On Wednesday 19 March 2025, we delivered a talk as part of Services Week 2025. This talk was called 'Using strategic content design to deliver better people-centred services' and was attended by nearly 200 people.

We've had so many supportive messages from people who want to keep the conversation going and use strategic content design in their roles. So, we've created an open-source GitHub repository that we can use as a strategic content design playbook.

We're going to start by uploading the resources we used to create our presentation. Then we'll work with the community to build this out into something we can all use to deliver better services through strategic content design.
