## The idea

On Wednesday 19 March 2025, we delivered a talk as part of Services Week 2025. This talk was called 'Using strategic content design to deliver better people-centred services' and was attended by nearly 200 people.

If you work in government, you can [watch the talk on YouTube([https://duckduckgo.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=u7Ud51ag3PdgQg2-&v=BVOmpMnQTuE&feature=youtu.be))

We've had so many supportive messages from people who want to keep the conversation going and use strategic content design in their roles. So, we've created an open-source GitHub repository that we can use as a strategic content design playbook.

We're going to start by uploading the resources we used to create our presentation. We'll then look to the wider community to help us build out this shared resource.

This is very much an experiment and proof of concept. By creating this resource on GitHub, we can quickly get information out into the open. It's also something that can be managed by the community.

If this works, we'll look at how we could publish this onto a website.

Thank you for your support,

Dom and Leyla
